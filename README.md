For this assignment, you will build hangman.  This time, you'll build it as a web app!

## MVP

1. The user must be able to play against the computer
1. The word that the computer chooses must be random. Feel free to use whatever list of words you want.
1. The user must have a limited number of guesses
1. After each guess, the website should display current state of the word you are guessing.  (ex. A _ _ L E, for apple)
1. After each guess the website should display a hangman image representing how many guesses are remaining.
1. The website should tell the user if she wins or loses
1. The user should be able to restart the game

## V2: Bonus

Integrate CSS to make your Hangman game look nicer.
